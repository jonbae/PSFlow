# System parity

The dual-run net over 1 scenario(s), against vendored `@xyflow/react` 12.11.0.

Captured by this run: both sides mounted the same unmodified fixtures through the same driver, bundled twice.

**1 of 1 scenario(s) failed.**

A failing net is the expected state while the divergence backlog is being worked: the scenarios below
are recording what the two implementations actually do, and a difference is fixed in the port or
claimed by a region — never by loosening what the net looks at.

| scenario | verdict | failure classes | differences |
|---|---|---|---|
| `click-selects-node--probe-flow-node` | **failed** | unclaimed-difference | 8 |

Every trace behind this report is on disk under `parity/system/traces` — four per scenario, two sides captured
twice each. They are the artifact: re-diffing them costs seconds and no browser.

# System parity run — click-selects-node--probe-flow-node

**Failed:** unclaimed-difference.

Compared sections: `callbacks`, `hooks`, `api`, `props`, `console`. All seven remain captured in the trace.

## Self-consistency

Each side is captured twice and compared against itself **before** the sides are compared at all: a
recorded trace baseline is meaningless if traces are not reproducible. In a plain run the driving log
takes part with no tolerance applied. Probe variants compare only their declared observation level, so
probe-induced rendering and pointer-resolution changes cannot contaminate that experiment.

| side | captures | verdict | differences |
|---|---|---|---|
| upstream | 1, 2 | reproduced | 0 |
| psflow | 1, 2 | reproduced | 0 |
