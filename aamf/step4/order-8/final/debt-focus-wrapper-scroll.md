# System parity run — debt-focus-wrapper-scroll

**Passed.** Both sides reproduced themselves, and the two sides agree everywhere unclaimed.

Compared sections: `driving`, `dom`, `callbacks`, `hooks`, `api`, `props`, `console`. All seven remain captured in the trace.

## Self-consistency

Each side is captured twice and compared against itself **before** the sides are compared at all: a
recorded trace baseline is meaningless if traces are not reproducible. In a plain run the driving log
takes part with no tolerance applied. Probe variants compare only their declared observation level, so
probe-induced rendering and pointer-resolution changes cannot contaminate that experiment.
